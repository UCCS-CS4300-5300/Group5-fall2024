## Updates

### **October 17, 2024**

#### Implemented Features and Fixes
- **Quiz and Question Models**
   - Adjusted the `Quiz` model to include a boolean `is_next` flag to indicate the next quiz.
   - Created the `Question` model with the following fields:
     - Foreign key to `Quiz`.
     - `translation_question` to hold the source language phrase.
     - `correct_answer` to store the correct translation.
     - `source_language` and `target_language` fields.
     - `difficulty` to categorize questions into Easy, Medium, or Hard.
   - Created a M:N relationship between quizzes and generated questions.

- **Management/Commands**
   - Created the `Management/Commands` directory to manage dynamic question loading.
   - Implemented a command that adds 30 translation questions (10 for each difficulty) into the database.

- **View Adjustments**
   - Moved all quiz templates into a newly created `quiz` folder under `templates`.
   - Filled out views for quiz operations including `quiz`, `quiz_recap`, `quiz_correct`, `quiz_incorrect`, and `next_question`.
   - Implemented the `next_question` view to handle question progression.
   - Adjusted the `generate_quiz` view to handle dynamic quiz generation based on difficulty.
   - Fixed how question IDs are linked to quizzes to prevent the same question from being displayed repeatedly.

- **Quiz Recap and Progress**
   - Created a `quiz_recap` template and view that provides a recap of quiz performance.
   - Handled session variables for quiz progress (`correct_count`, `incorrect_count`, `question_id`) to ensure smooth tracking of user performance.

- **Random Feedback**
   - Added pools of positive and negative feedback in the `quiz_correct` and `quiz_incorrect` views to display random feedback after each question.

- **Styling Improvements**
   - Hid the "Goal" dropdown in the navbar for now, as that feature is pending future development.
   - Ensured the Play button has a consistent 3D appearance with enhanced depth and shadows for better visual feedback.

- **Navbar Dropdown Menus**
   - The dropdown menus in the navbar no longer hover or float unintentionally.
   - Dropdown selections are now properly displayed, reflecting the chosen difficulty level.
   
- **Play Button**
   - Separated the Play button styling from other items in the `styles.css` file.
   - Fixed the hover behavior of the Play button to lift up instead of enlarging.
   - Made the Play button dynamically scale when active and ensured it remains aligned with the card element.
   - Disabled the Play button if no quiz is available.

### Feature Added: User Registration (10/14/2024)

- **Added** the ability for the user to create an account and log in to the website.
- **Added** two new templates in the "authentication" folder called `login.html` and `register.html`.
- **Added** `forms.py`, which allows for defining a form with information that must be filled by the user to register.
- **Added** `decorators.py`. So far, it only has one decorator that prevents logged-in users from accessing the registration and login links.
- **Added** pytests to ensure that logging in, logging out, and failsafes work correctly.
- **Updated** `models.py` to include a new model called "Member," which represents a single user and contains fields such as first and last name.
- **Updated** `urls.py` to include links for registration, logging in, and logging out.
- **Updated** `views.py` to handle registration, logging in, and logging out processes.
- **Modified** the base template to display the username of the logged-in member. If the user is logged in, the human icon, when clicked, logs the user out (for now).
- **Modified** the base template to make the human icon redirect the user to the login page (if they are not logged in already).
- **BUG**: The logout view doesn't redirect users back to the homepage but instead to the login page, even though there is logic that states otherwise...

### Feature Added: Word of the Day
